# Data Structures Project

An exemplary programmer, in order to be able to solve a problem in the most efficient way, should know data structures extremely well! The repository's goal is to show the Python implementation of some of the most common data structures, so that you can learn how they work and what operations they support.

The implementation details are explained in comments and docs.

# Usage

If you want to use some of these data structures, run the following command in your project folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/cosimonegri/data-structures.git
```

Then import the desired data structure in your file:

```
from data-structures.src.datastructures import DSName
```

with the actual data structure name instead of DSName

## Run Tests

To run all tests at once:

```
cd data-structures
cd src
python run_tests.py
```
